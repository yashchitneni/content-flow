1. Introduction
This Functional Requirements Document (FRD) translates the high-level business needs for ContentFlow into detailed, specific system behaviors. This document serves as the primary specification for development and quality assurance teams, defining exactly how the system shall behave in response to user actions and external events.
Every functional requirement documented here is traceable to the core business need: automating and enhancing the content creation workflow from video file management through transcript processing to social media content generation.
2. Functional Requirements
The functional requirements are organized by the six primary screens/modules of the ContentFlow application, each supporting specific aspects of the content creation workflow.
